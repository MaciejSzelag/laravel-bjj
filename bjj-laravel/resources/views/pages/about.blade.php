            <p class="about_p">
                We offer a simple clean safe environment to train and have fun. Our focus is on our large matted area
                with
                padded flooring for comfort and safety. There are changing facilities and adequate storage for bags.
                There

                is
                important in a gym environment so we have simple rules about cleanliness e.g. making sure training gear
                is
                washed after each session, not wearing shoes on the mats, wearing shoes to the bathroom and we make sure
                mats are cleaned and disinfected regularly.
